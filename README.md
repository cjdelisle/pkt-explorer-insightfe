# PKT Block Explorer

This is a frontend which is designed to work with the
[PKT Explorer Backend](https://github.com/cjdelisle/pkt-explorer-backend).
It is based on the [Bitcore Insight](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/tree/master/packages/insight)
project but is not currently compatible with the Bitcore backend.

## Quick Start

To get started, setup the [PKT Explorer Backend](https://github.com/cjdelisle/pkt-explorer-backend)

And then launch the frontend as follows:

```sh
CHAIN=PKT NETWORK=pkt npm start
```
